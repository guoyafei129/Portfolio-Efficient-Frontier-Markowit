# Portfolio-Efficient-Frontier-Markowit
he Markowitz Efficient Frontier is the set of all efficient portfolios, i.e., portfolios that have give the highest expected return for a given level of risk (standard deviation). In this section, you will implement the fundamental calculations to find efficient (minimum variance) portfolios, as well as the global minimum variance portfolio.
